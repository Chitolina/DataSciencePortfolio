Hi, Iâ€™m Lucas Chitolina, passionate about learning and the worlds you discover through it. Iâ€™m qualified for M.Sc. in Molecular Biology with practical experience with Linux and **Python**. As a Biologist, I am interested in studying life and the methodologies that help in data exploration (biological or not) to make its interpretation accessible to everyone. Along this path, I seek to improve my knowledge in data analysis with Python language and in implementing the value of data in several models.  

Through the posts, I expect to improve my skills and will appreciate your time coming by ðŸŒ±  
**Most of the time I'm going to focus on the English language for practicing purposes.**
